# Operation Sheldon

Rock paper scissors game Sheldon style. Just a little pet project of mine to work on :) 

## First phase: 
Regular rock paper scissors game in javascript.
## Second phase: 
Regular rock paper scissors game in python (for excercise).
## Third phase: 
Modifying the code to Big bang theory version of the game.
## Fourth phase: 
Figuring out how to turn it into a web app, the entire UI, graphics, user experience and adding of more features.
## Fifth phase: 
Putting it all together, deploying it with Heroku.
## Sixth phase: (advanced, later stage):
Make it so that game can be played among humans as well - not just AI vs. humans.
