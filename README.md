# Operation Sheldon

Rock paper scissors game Sheldon style.

> Sheldon: "It's very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock,rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and—as it always has—rock crushes scissors"

Just a pet project to speed up my javascript learning process :)

## First phase: 
Regular rock paper scissors game in javascript.
## Second phase: 
Regular rock paper scissors game in python (for excercise).
## Third phase: 
Modifying the code to Big bang theory version of the game. 
## Fourth phase: 
Figuring out how to turn it into a web app, the entire UI, graphics, user experience and adding of more features.
## Fifth phase: 
Putting it all together, deploying it with Heroku.
## Sixth phase: (advanced, later stage):
Make it so that game can be played among humans as well - not just AI vs. humans.
